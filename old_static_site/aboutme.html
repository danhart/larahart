                    <p>
                    I am an experienced Gestalt counsellor offering counselling to both individuals and couples. I work with clients on a long-term, open-ended basis or for an agreed period, across a range of ethnic, cultural and social backgrounds. I am qualified with a Diploma in Counselling and a Post-Graduate Diploma in Gestalt Therapy. I am a member of the <a href="http://www.bacp.co.uk/" target="_blank">British Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapists (BACP)</a>.  I abide by and work within its code of ethics. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    My experience is wide and includes working with clients suffering anxiety, depression, loss and bereavement. I welcome working with those who are focusing on personal growth and others finding it hard to adjust to important life transitions or milestones. Adjusting to change can be extremely distressing or difficult to manage. I hope that through counselling, clients will move towards finding new meaning and purpose in life.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4 id="sexandrelheading">Sexual and Relationship Therapy</h4>
                    <p>
                    Additional training as a Psychosexual and Relationship Counsellor qualifies me to work with both individuals and couples who wish to focus on issues relating to sexuality, relationships and intimacy. An important aspect of my work relates to issues around <a href="http://www.hfea.gov.uk" target="_blank">fertility</a>. This includes working with couples who have experiences relating to childlessness, sub- and infertility and ‘assisted conception’. I support couples who are feeling the impact of these and other issues on their relationship. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    I also work with individuals who experience sexual concerns or dysfunctions, such as erectile difficulties or anorgasmia. I am a member of the <a href="http://www.basrt.org.uk/" target="_blank">British Association of Sexual and Relationship Therapy (BASRT)</a>.
                    </p>
                    

                    <h4 id="previouslyheading">Previously…</h4>
                    ….I worked in the field of education. I have over 25 years experience as a teacher, specialising in specific learning differences and dyslexic ways of thinking and learning. This includes working with children, teenagers and adults experiencing perception, memory, organisation and language difficulties. Struggles around these areas may have an impact on self-esteem, achievement and learning in both school and work environments. Working together creatively, I hope that clients develop skills, confidence in their abilities and a positive attitude to their dyslexic way of being.
