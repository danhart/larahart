                <p>My approach to counselling is broadly Gestalt based, with other approaches, such as CBT, integrated as needed. The German word Gestalt is not easily translated into a single English term. It embraces a wide variety of concepts: the shape, the pattern, the whole form, the configuration. The aim of the Gestalt approach is for a person to discover, explore, and experience his or her own shape, pattern and wholeness. Gestalt therapy therefore takes a holistic approach to counselling - mind, body and spirit. It aims to help you develop greater self-awareness of who you are and how you are being, in relation to others and your environment.</p>
                
                <h4 id="changeheading">Change</h4>
                <p>Many who come to counselling talk about unfinished business, which they would like to resolve. They often describe carrying baggage from the past. In exploring difficult memories and emotions and in making links with the past, therapy can reveal the impact of unresolved issues on the present. In the process clients come to recognise their own patterns and habits, those that are helpful and nourishing, and others that get in the way of meeting current needs. This approach can focus on incomplete earlier experiences, or beliefs and behaviours that are no longer useful or healthy. Change occurs by bringing this awareness to meet life’s experiences and challenges.</p>
                
                <h4 id="autonomyheading">Autonomy</h4>
                <p>Through counselling clients are able to discover or uncover their own resources. This enables them to respond to life’s challenges in more flexible, appropriate and self-fulfilling ways and so move towards greater autonomy as the author of their life.</p>
                
                <h4 id="creativityheading">Creativity</h4>
                Although primarily a talking therapy, the Gestalt approach offers clients, if they wish, the opportunity to find other creative ways of expressing thoughts and feelings, such as through drawing, movement and enactment and through exploration of dreams, metaphor and imagery.
